Project 1: Maze Game

About the game:
My team and I have come up with an idea of creating a simple interactive
terminal app game by using Ruby language. You can always use the code to create Pac-man. 

Installation: 
To run the program you will require 2 different gems; paint and terminal-table

Paint gem
gem install paint

If you get an error message, trying putting 'sudo' at the front. 

Terminal Table
gem install terminal-table

Again if you get an error, trype in 'sudo' at the front.
